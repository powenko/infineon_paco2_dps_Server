## Description

The `infineon_paco2_dps_Server` project is designed to interface with Infineon's PAS CO2 sensor and DPS (Digital Pressure Sensor) hardware. This repository contains scripts and libraries necessary for setting up and running a server that communicates with these sensors, collecting and processing environmental data.

## Hardware

**infineon_paco2_dps_lib** is a Python library for interfacing with Infineon's PA_CO2 and DPS sensors. This library provides a simple and convenient way to read temperature, pressure, and CO2 concentration data from these sensors.

This image is a PCB board for this project, which can work on a Raspberry Pi. This board, called the "Infineon optimus Board," can be purchased at [www.ifroglab.com](http://www.ifroglab.com).


## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/infineon_paco2_dps_Server.git
   cd infineon_paco2_dps_Server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   This project requires Python and several Python packages. Install the necessary packages using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the hardware:**

   Connect your Infineon PAS CO2 sensor and DPS hardware to your system according to the manufacturer's instructions.

## Usage

To run the server and start collecting data from the sensors:

1. Ensure your hardware is properly connected.
2. Execute the script:

   ```bash
   python sever.py
   ```

   The server will start and begin collecting data from the sensors. You can access the collected data through the server's API endpoints (if applicable).

## Configuration

If your script requires any specific configuration, mention how users can modify the configuration files or environment variables to suit their setup.

## Detailed Server Overview

The **infineon_paco2_dps_server** Python code is designed to facilitate easy interaction with Infineonâ€™s PA_CO2 and DPS sensors using the I2C protocol. The library abstracts the complexity involved in sensor communication, providing straightforward methods to retrieve sensor data.

### DPS Sensor

The Infineon DPS310 is a high-precision pressure sensor capable of measuring temperature and pressure. It is commonly used in applications such as weather stations, altimeters, and other environmental monitoring systems. The dps class in this library provides methods to initialize the sensor, configure its settings, and read data.

#### Temperature and Pressure Measurement

The Infineon DPS310 sensor uses advanced calibration algorithms to ensure accurate readings. The `read_temperature` method retrieves the temperature by reading raw sensor data, scaling it, and applying calibration coefficients. Similarly, the `read_pressure` method processes raw pressure data to provide precise measurements.

### PA_CO2 Sensor

The Infineon PA_CO2 sensor measures CO2 concentration in the environment. It is useful in applications such as indoor air quality monitoring, HVAC systems, and industrial safety.

#### CO2 Measurement

The `measure_co2` method triggers the sensor to perform a CO2 concentration measurement. It reads raw data from the sensor, processes it, and returns the CO2 level in parts per million (ppm). This method ensures reliable and accurate CO2 monitoring for various applications.
